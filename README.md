### üîß Installation & Setup

This project uses a **monorepo structure** with separate `frontend` and `backend` folders.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/finbot.git
   cd finbot
   ```

2. **Backend Setup** (in a new terminal)
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

   - **Create Configuration File**  
     Inside `backend`, create a `config.json` file. Use the template below and fill in your API keys and paths.

     ```json
     {
       "app": {
         "version": "1.0.0",
         "paths": {
           "base": "/path/to/your/FinBot/project/folder/"
         }
       },
       "model": {
         "gemini": {
           "name": "gemini-embedding-001",
           "api_key": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
         }
       },
       "openai": {
         "credentials": {
           "default": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
         },
         "models": {
           "default": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18",
           "answer_relevancy": "gpt-4o-mini"
         }
       },
       "service_discovery": {
         "app": {
           "server_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8761/FinBot",
           "instance_host": "127.0.0.1",
           "app_name": "FinBot",
           "eureka_protocol": "http",
           "status_page_url": "FinBot/info",
           "home_page_url": "FinBot/info",
           "health_check_url": "FinBot/info",
           "instance_port": 5050,
           "port": 5050
         }
       }
     }
     ```

     ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Do **not** commit your `config.json` with real API keys to a public repository.  
     Add it to your `.gitignore` file.

   - **Install Python Dependencies**
     ```bash
     uv sync
     ```

   - **Run the Data Scraper**  
     Before starting the server, run the `scraper.ipynb` notebook to collect necessary data.  
     You can execute it using Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or directly in VS Code.  
     Ensure all cells run successfully.

3. **Frontend Setup** (in another terminal)
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

You‚Äôll need **two terminals**: one for the backend and one for the frontend.

#### Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
The backend will run on the port specified in `config.json` (e.g., [http://127.0.0.1:5050](http://127.0.0.1:5050)).

#### Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to:  
üëâ [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
